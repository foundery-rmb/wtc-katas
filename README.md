# wtc-katas

This is intended to be a collection of Katas that the We Think Code Students will be contributing to.

If a Kata does not have a solution yet, you can create the kata on the master branch. If the kata does have a solution,
a suggestion would be to create a branch with the naming convention: yourname-kataname-version, i.e. theo-guilded-rose-1.
If you then believe that your version should be the reference implementation, you can create a pull request and a couple of you can go through it together to decide if it should indeed be accepted.

I also suggest that we create a folder per language per kata, as in

FizzBuzz --> C# --> implementation

## Examples of Katas would be:

#FizzBuzz
#StringCalculator
#RomanNumerals
#GuildedRose
#BowlingKata

## guidelines

1. Always use tests unlesss otherwise stated for a specific reason
2. Any langauge that you are comfortable in, or would like to learn. A suggestion is to first do it in a language you are comfortable in and then in a new language.
3. Use the Four rules of simple design as a guideline.
4. When writing tests, red-green-refactor.
